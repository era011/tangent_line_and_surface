# tangent_surface


A tangent_surface function has been written that returns the equation of the tangent plane to the surface kind

$$f(x,y)=f'_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+f'_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)+f(x_0,y_0)$$

at the point $(x0,y0)$, as well as a function for the value of the partial derivative at the point.

For surface 

$$f(x,y) = (x+1)^2+(x+2)^2$$

at point $(\frac{\pi}{2},\frac{\pi}{2})$ we get the following picture
