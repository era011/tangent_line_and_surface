# tangent_line_and_surface


A tangent_surface function has been written that returns the equation of the tangent plane to the surface kind

$$f(x,y)=f'_x(x_0,y_0)(x-x_0)+f'_y(x_0,y_0)(y-y_0)+f(x_0,y_0)$$

at the point $(x0,y0)$, as well as a function for the value of the partial derivative at the point
